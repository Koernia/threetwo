### ThreeTwo UI 

##### I have tried my best to document the project through folder organization, comments, and actual JSDocs where applicable.
##### Unit tests and I have not agreed for a long time now, and I think it won't change anytime soon.


This folder houses all the components, utils and libraries that make up ThreeTwo's UI

It is based on React 17, and uses:

1. _Redux_ for state management
2. _socket.io_ for transferring data in real-time
3. _React Router_ for routing
