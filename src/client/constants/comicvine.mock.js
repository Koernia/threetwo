He helped gather the fortune his son now inherited. Old man Howlett wanted to live out his last years in peace, living in the mansion with his son and grandson. Old Man Howlett was already a senior when young James Howlett was still a young boy. His grandfather had a strong no nonscence mentality and often classed with James\' father.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Old Man Howlett was created by Paul Jenkins, Joe Quasada and Andy Kubert and first appeared in <a href="https://www.comicvine.com/origin-1-the-hill/4000-110022/">Origin issue 1 </a>(2001).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Murders</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31599/1740698-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1740698" data-size="medium" data-ratio="0.5150421179302" data-width="831" data-embed-type="image" style="width: 831px"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:51.5%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31599/1740698-07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1740698"><img alt="The Old Man " src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31599/1740698-07.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/3/31599/1740698-07.jpg 831w, https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31599/1740698-07.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" data-width="480"></a><figcaption>The Old Man </figcaption></figure><p>After the massacre that left old man Howlett\'s son John murdered, and his daughter by law (James\' mother) dead, he helped James and long time friend Rose fleeing the mansion, giving them money to leave. Old man Howlett thought James to be somehow, but unwillingly, part of the massacre. Years later, the Old Man lay on his deathbed and had a change of sight. He wanted to find his grandson back, in order to keep the family name going. He had <a href="/dog-logan/4005-44327/" data-ref-id="4005-44327">Dog</a> (son of <a href="/thomas-logan/4005-44323/" data-ref-id="4005-44323">Thomas Logan</a>, the person who started the massacre in the mansion many years ago) track James and Rose down to bring them home. This was however misinterpreted-ed by Dog, who sought to find and bring the pair back by whatever means. How and when Old Man Howlett died was never told, although it is fairly certain he never again saw his grandson, James Howlett, aka Wolverine.</p><p> </p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Earth-4011 (Wolverine The End)</h3><p><b>For more information see:<a href="/wolverine-the-end/4050-10811/" data-ref-id="4050-10811">Wolverine: The End</a></b></p><p>In this reality, John and Elizabeth\'s first son <a href="/john-howlett/4005-4657/" data-ref-id="4005-4657">John Howlett Jr.</a> didn\'t die mysterious. Instead, he got angry at his mother, Elizabeth and cut her with his claws. John Sr. didn\'t know what to do, but the Old Man promised to take care of the boy. He took John Jr., to a mental hospital and left him there. It is unclear if the Old Man ever told his son where he took their son.</p>',

He tells Ken that he was just in a fight with some unnamed enemies and is on his last legs. He hypnotizes Connell. When Ken wakes up, the Old Man is gone, but Ken remembers some more of what he told him--that the Old Man has been looking for someone like Ken for a long time. He transfers a special tattoo to Ken: the <a href="/star-brand/4055-43199/" data-ref-id="4055-43199">Star Brand</a>, a "weapon" of great power. Ken finds the Old Man\'s body, except he\'s now dead, and looks like an alien. Ken buries him and leaves.</p><p>The Old Man, however, isn\'t dead or an alien. He is a Dutch nobleman from 500 years ago. One day he suddenly gains the Star Brand\'s powers. He has the Brand for centuries, growing taller all the time, but eventually he tires of it, and wants to get rid of it by passing it off onto an asteroid.

When he does, he wants the Brand back, saying he needs it for a battle against oppression on the other side of the universe. He hypnotizes and hurts Ken\'s other girlfriend <a href="/debbie/4005-30335/" data-ref-id="4005-30335">Duck</a> and Ken battles him in distant outer space, once again seemingly beating him. However, he soon leaves messages written around the houses of Ken and his family, saying things like, "The Brand or people die!" His psychological war on Ken starts to take its toll. Finally he calls Ken and tells him to show up at Duck\'s room in the hospital, or he\'ll kill her. Ken shows up, but he says the Old Man can go ahead and kill her if he has to--Ken is going to stop him no matter what, because he\'s too much of a threat. The Old Man is stunned at this response. Ken takes advantage and punches him out of the hospital. They fight again, and as usual, Ken seems to kill him. This time he throws the body into space.</p><p>All this time, Ken is totally confused--was the Old Man the alien, or not? Why did he give him the Brand only to ask for it back? Was the Old Man fighting a war in space? And if so, was he on the side of good or evil?</p><p>The Old Man once again returns to fight him at a comic book convention, and Ken kills everyone there in the battle. When the Old Man once again "dies," his memories are transferred to Ken, and he finally understands who he really was. Ken decides he wants to get rid of the Brand himself, and in trying to do so, he destroys Pittsburgh.</p><p>Later, Ken has a child with Debbie the Duck, which becomes the <a href="/the-star-brand-baby/4005-29807/" data-ref-id="4005-29807">Starchild</a>, a baby with the power of the Star Brand. Ken loses the Brand. The Old Man returns once more. Finally the Starchild brings all the wielders of the Star Brand together. It turns out that the White Event, caused by the Old Man trying to transfer his powers to the asteroid, also sent Connell and the Star Brand power 500 years back in the past, and so the Old Man is actually Connell. In fact, the Starchild, Ken, and the Old Man are all the same, and the Starchild merges them all together to rectify their temporal paradox.  Playing with time and reality, the unified being sends Ken\'s essence is sent back in time to become the Old Man; the Starchild becomes the contemporary Ken; and the Old Man becomes the Starchild right before he is born.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Old Man originally had control of the Star Brand, an incredibly powerful weapon. It can bestow upon even an inexperienced user nuclear-level, omnidirectional energy blasts, superhuman strength, flight, the ability to survive in space, immortality, and durability capable of surviving a nuclear bomb at ground zero. More experienced users can achieve almost limitless other effects.</p><p>After he gave the Brand to the young Ken Connell, he only retained 10% of its power. Even this enabled him to shape-shift, possess great strength and durability, regenerate from near-death on multiple occasions, create high-level energy blasts, and hypnotize people (as he did to Ken, Barb\'s daughter Laurie, and Duck), among other powers. Because he was so much more experienced with the Brand\'s powers, he was capable of fighting the young Ken (who had the full Star Brand) on a fairly equal footing.</p><p>In his alien form, he wears battle armor and carries powerful laser guns. He is capable of sinking his ship and weapons under the earth so they cannot be detected.</p>',

It was recently discovered by Ichigo, however that this manifestation is actually the embodiment of Ichigo\'s <a href="/quincy/4060-59703/" data-ref-id="4060-59703">Quincy</a> powers, taking the form of <a href="//www.comicvine.com/yhwach/4005-85518/" data-ref-id="4005-85518">Yhwach</a>, the Quincy King as he looked one thousand years ago, and not of his Zanpakuto. He impersonated Zangetsu in order to suppress Ichigo\'s Shinigami powers and hinder him from becoming a Shinigami. He states that if it happened, Ichigo would eventually die by his very hands. He even went so far as to be Ichigo\'s primary source of power. However, in time as Yhwach watched Ichigo through the many battles, pain, suffering and experiences, his heart began to waver. He eventually changes his mind, wanting to help Ichigo and watch him succeed. He tells him that the power he\'s been wielding up to that point, was only a portion of his powers. Yhwach decides to relinquish his hold on Ichigo and states that the time has finally come for the latter to fight with his own, true power. Yhwach\'s form dissipates and a glowing zanpakuto appears in his place. He tells Ichigo to take it for it is his true Zanpakuto.</p><p>He looks to be a man somewhere in his late thirties to mid forties. He has long, black hair and scruffy-looking stubble on his face. Yhwach wears semi-transparent sunglasses and a long black coat/cape with a string connecting the shoulder and the lapel.</p><p>As far as his personality goes, he is serene and straight forward. His actions speak for themselves and he speaks only when he he feels it is necessary. Most of the time, he is Ichigo\'s voice of reason. He is also a strong, capable and formidable combatant, not to be taken lightly. Yhwach resides within Ichigo\'s inner world (mind), a place that is completely sideways, from the clouds in the sky to the buildings and skyscrapers in the fore and background.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>Tensa Zangetsu</h3><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1274136-tensa_zangetsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1274136" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.0592503022975"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:105.9%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1274136-tensa_zangetsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1274136"><img alt="Tensa Zangetsu" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1274136-tensa_zangetsu.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/6/63278/1274136-tensa_zangetsu.jpg 827w" sizes="(max-width: 906px) 100vw, 906px" data-width="906"></a><figcaption>Tensa Zangetsu</figcaption></figure><p>He is the embodiment of Ichigo\'s bankai. <em>Tensa Zangetsu </em>looks to be a young man in his late teens to mid twenties.

Logan 5 lives in a domed city known as "a perfect world of total pleasure" where the people are suppose to be renewed at the age of 30 during an event called Carousel. What no ones knows is the people are actually killed and that the renewal is just a myth meant to make people comfortable. The whole thing is meant to maintain the population of the city.</p><p>The ages of the populace are kept tracked of by the main computer by a Palm Flower Crystal implanted in the right hand. The color changes from white to yellow to green to red. At the age of thirty the Palm Flower Crystal blinks red. and on the thirtieth birthday known as Last Day they go to renewal.</p><p>Some people are afraid that renewal is a myth and and attempt to run away at the age of 30. When this happens it is the job of a Sandman to find then and nullify (kill) them. That is where Logan 5 comes in. Logan 5 is a Sandman who fully believes in renewal. Things go fine until he nullifies a runner who carries on Ankh symbol on his.</p><figure data-align="right" data-img-src="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1682473-19_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1682473" data-size="medium" data-embed-type="image" data-ratio="1.2873345935728"><a class="fluid-height" style="padding-bottom:128.7%" href="https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1682473-19_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-1682473"><img alt="Jessica 6, Logan 5" src="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1682473-19_1.jpg" srcset="https://comicvine1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/original/0/9541/1682473-19_1.jpg 529w" sizes="(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px" data-width="745"></a><figcaption>Jessica 6, Logan 5</figcaption></figure><p>When Logan if debriefed by the main computer he finds that the Ankh symbol is also the symbol for a place known as sanctuary where runners are trying to escape to. The computer then changes Logan 5\'s age from 26 to 30 to allow him to infiltrate the underground movement. Logan goes along with the plan even though he does not know if the computer will give him his four years back.</p><p>He meets up with a woman known as <a href="/jessica-6/4005-76268/" data-ref-id="4005-76268">Jessica 6</a> whom he met earlier and who wears the Ankh around her neck. He tries to get her friends to show them where sanctuary is and at first they try to kill him but are eventually convinced that he is really trying to find sanctuary.</p><p>The two find out the sanctuary doesn\'t exist and all the others that went before them were killed when that were frozen by an automated robot that froze them as meat.

He was just unable to see that the reasons for their culture were no longer needed and that the Palm Flower Crystal didn\'t even work outside the city.</p><p>Logan and Jessica decide to go back to the dome city and show everyone what they have discovered.

Dog Logan grows up on the estate and becomes somewhat of a protegee to the old man Howlett Senior. Later, on his deathbed, Howlett Senior wishes to make amends with his grandson, James. He sends Dog to find him and bring him back. Dog tracks him so well even after so many years that it seems his tracking skills are not altogether human. Dog however has diferent plans then what he was ordered to by Howlett Senior as he tries to kill Rose and James.

He seems to share the same longer life-span as Wolverine and Sabretooth.</p><p> </p><h2>Dog and Sabretooth Connection</h2><p>Based on the most current data, there is no source material that states as canon in the Marvel Universe that Dog is Sabretooth. Despite this, fans on the internet have been inferring or implying the opposite.</p><p>An interviewer asked <a href="/paul-jenkins/4040-41631/" data-ref-id="4040-41631">Paul Jenkins</a> if the character Dog Logan was <a href="/sabretooth/4005-4563/" data-ref-id="4005-4563">Sabretooth</a>. Paul Jenkins said he had not intended it to be him, but said he wouldn\'t have a problem with another writer doing it later. Despite that no writer has yet written a story that Dog is Sabretooth, fans have been spreading unfounded rumors on the internet about Dog and Sabretooth. Sabretooth and Dog have similar characteristics and traits, both are big caucasian males with similar appearances, both enjoy killing, both have grudges against Wolverine, both have abusive fathers, and both possess excellent tracking skills. With no proof, fans are only able to imply or infer their ideas from these supposed similarities.</p><p>Recently, the comic <a href="/x-men-origins-sabretooth/4050-25745/" data-ref-id="4050-25745">X-Men Origins: Sabretooth</a> was released, showing Sabretooth\'s own origin. It seems that he and Dog are really two separate characters and any similarities are just coincidental.</p><p> </p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dog Logan was created by Frank Tieri and Sean Chen and first appeared shadowed in Wolverine issue 166 (2001) and first appeared fully in Origin issue 1, where he was further developed by Paul Jenkins, Joe Quesada and Andy Kubert.</p>',

Logan wanted the police and the media to look like fools and he started stealing numerous items that started with the letters that spelled Leaper.

The Masked Marvel was having a hard time controlling his direction during the fight and Leaper Logan was able to escape by scaling a building with his suction pads. Robbie found a list that his father compiled of Logan\'s crimes and discovered that he was spelling his name with the crimes he was committing. Logan\'s next move had to do something with the letter R and the Masked Marvel intercepted Leaper Logan at the Hammond Museum when he stole a Roman coin collection. The Masked Marvel chased Leaper Logan all over town until the leaping criminal landed in front of a cop named Burnatt who was the first officer to ever bust Logan.
